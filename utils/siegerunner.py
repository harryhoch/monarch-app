# Siegerunner.py
# 
# A utility script for using the Siege load testing tool 
# (http://www.joedog.org/siege-home/)  to bang on the Monarch services
# 
# This script will make requests of Monarch services, of the form
#   $HOST/disease/OMIM_XXXXXXX and
#   $host/phenotype/HP_XXXXXXX, simulating each request with some number of users as 
#     per siege 
# 
# Disease and HP identifiers will be chosen randomly, up to a given ceiling 
# (15,000 for HP and 1,000,000 for OMIM). This crude scheme guarantees that many of the 
# IDs will be chosen will not be hits, but that's ok for the purposes of load testing - 
# the Monarch services should still behave correctly. The range of possible values 
# can be adjusted if desired - see below
