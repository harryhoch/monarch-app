##
## The Golr config that will be used for the majority of associations in Monarch
##
## The model is roughly OBAN: https://github.com/jamesmalone/OBAN
##
## Note: initial implementation - fields will change in future
##
## This schema is a generalization of the one used for GO/AmiGO 2. See: https://github.com/geneontology/amigo/blob/master/metadata/ann-config.yaml
## A few points are worth bearing in mind when aligning the schema:
##
##  * GO sometimes uses standard terms like 'source' a little differently than standards like DC
##  * The OBAN 'subject' is always a bioentity (e.g. gene/product, complex, phylo tree node) in GO
##  * The OBAN 'object' is always a class in GO
##  * GO uses various ad-hoc fields such as 'secondary taxon' that would not be applicable here
